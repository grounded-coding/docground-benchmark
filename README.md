# Overview

Please start by downloading the data using download_dataset.py

## Pipelines

A pipeline can be configured with a data collector (for model predictions), eval frameworks (for system evaluations) and eval collector (for human evaluation) to compute correlations.

## Example

Refer to pipelines/example for an example on the TopicalChat dataset comparing some of the implemented evaluation frameworks.
